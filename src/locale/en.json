      "p1": "Hi! I'm Naomi, a drawer and comic artist.",
      "p2": "What are the artistic expressions that allow us to express ourselves in the most truthful way? For me, it's comics. Since I was 13, comics have been my tool to translate my thoughts, my experiences, and the world I see into sketches and lines on paper.",
      "p3": "I believe that art does not have to be realistic to be truthful. My drawings are simple at first glance, but every line, every shape, and every color tells a story. They reflect my personality, my humor, and my love for what I do.",
      "p4": "I draw, but essentially, I illustrate stories. My comics reflect the world at eye level, with a cynical smile and a light heart. I enjoy breaking conventions, playing with expectations, and making people think and smile.",
      "p5": "So if you love comics that are not just black and white, if you are looking for something slightly different, if you want to try art that is both light and deep - you are invited to contact me. I am waiting to hear from you and create your next story in lines and colors."
